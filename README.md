A few small python tools to help productivity. Includes an empathy robot and a timer that pops up a terminal window upon time completion.

Run python empathybot.py in order to get a live chatbot to help be empathetic to your problems.  
It has Timothy Chu's preloaded responses, so rest assured that the empathy is real!

Run timer.py, and then enter the number of minutes you want the timer to run for.
At the end of the time, a terminal window will pop up, and the sound clip will play announcing 'time!'
